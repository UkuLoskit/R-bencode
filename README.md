Bencode encoder and decoder for R
=================================

Bencode is a terse format encoding used mostly in BitTorrent. It supports the
following types: byte strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries. See the
[specifications](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Bencoding) for
more.

Bencode is also used as a transport protocol for Clojure
[network REPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl).
